# John Conway Game of Life
https://github.com/jcooksley/Game-of-Life

## Software Developement Plan

### Application Description
The application will be a John Conway Game of Life. In John Conway's Game of Life you have an infinite grid of cells that each have one of two states, dead or alive, each cell has 8 neighbours that are adjacent. In each generation the three rules are applied to each cell, the three rules are as follows: 
1. Any Live Cell with two or three live neighbours survives  
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell  
3. All other lives stay alive and all other dead cells stay dead  

### Problem to solve
This solves the problem of boredom, as the game of life can have infinite generations, it is literally unlimited fun

### Target audience



## Features

### Generate game of life

### Allow user to change starting board of game of life

### Track life of a cell

### Saving/Loading of custom boards

## Outline
User will get a greeting message and prompted to set up settings of board or use default settings
once settings have been set the game of life will start generating, showing how many states it has progresssed through, user will be able to stop the generating at any point, the user will then be prompted to save their state.

## Help Documentation

### To use the app
In your terminal change directories to the src folder  
        ex:  
        cd Documents/games-of-life/src
once in the src directory run the run_game_of_life.sh file
ex:
./run_game_of_life.sh

it is best to have your terminal in max resolution so you can view the largest grid possible at once
